# Common Folder

This folder is for code, types, and configs shared between the frontend and backend.

**Examples:**
- API type definitions (TypeScript interfaces)
- Validation schemas (e.g., Joi, Zod)
- Shared constants (e.g., user roles, point limits)
- Utility functions

**Usage:**
- Import from `../common` in both backend and frontend code.
